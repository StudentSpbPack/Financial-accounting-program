# Financial-accounting-program
Hallo everyone! I am junior programmer and that my financial accounting program with one-dimension/two-dimension of array. I will be glad to absolutely any criticism or advice about code (:


The essence of the task is as follows:
The management of the company keeps records of expenses and receipts for 12 months.

During the year, two arrays were received - expenses and receipts.
Determine profits by month
The number of months with a positive profit.

Add the ability to display the three worst indicators by month, with the worst profit,
if there are several months, in some the worst profit coincided - withdraw them all.
